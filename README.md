# nu_468project
Project for CUDA. We implement two different attacks (brute force and dictionary) for passwords on both the GPU and CPU. Also, we implement two different encryption algorithms (RSA and AES) on both the GPU and CPU. Speedup is measured by CPU_execution_time / GPU_execution_time. This project showcases the ability to add code.
